The `/etc/passwd` file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the `/etc/passwd` file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the `/etc/passwd` file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the `/etc/passwd file` to `/etc/shadow` . The `/etc/shadow` file is set so only root will be able to read and write.
